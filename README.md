˙✧˖°🎮 ⋆｡˚ Sprig 👾⁺˚⋆｡°✩₊

For this workshop, students first explored how code can be used to make games through the Sprig engine, then used javascript to code simple games based on the getting-started tutorial in the Sprig gallery!

Students were introduced to the basics of coding languages through a themed slideshow, then a code-a-long using the sprig engine to complete the getting-started tutorial. We helped each student through various bugs and questions they had about the code, from changing sprite color, to the x-y-axis. Below is a picture of a sprig game a student made!
