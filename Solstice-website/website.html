        <h2>Solstice is a Coding Party</h2>
        <p>Solstice is a social coding event open to all middle and high school students from the Boys and Girls Club of Lake County. We'll come together for a day to discover the joy of code, build creative projects, and share them with the world!</p>
        <p>Solstice is organized in public by teenagers just like yourself at Hack Club - and we want you to contribute! Join us in the #chicago-day-of-service channel on the Hack Club Slack to help craft this event into something truly magical.</p>
